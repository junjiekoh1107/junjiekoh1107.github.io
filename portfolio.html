									<h2>Hobbies and Interests</h2>
									<p>Outside of tech, I’m actively involved in the cheerleading community, which has helped me develop teamwork, discipline, and a strong sense of collaboration. Being part of a team that performs under pressure has taught me a lot about trust and communication—skills I find valuable in both sports and work settings.</p>
									<p>I'm also interested in the culinary world, especially Japanese sake. I’ve earned a certification as an International Kikisake-shi (Sake Sommelier), which gave me a deeper appreciation for food culture and the details that go into craft and tradition. I enjoy exploring interests that challenge me in different ways and keep me curious.</p>

											<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/webapp.png" alt="" /></a>
											<h3>My First Web App</h3>
											<p> Creating a Simple Network Scanner that is accessible from a web browser on the network, using a Cron Job every 10 minutes to
												trigger nmap to scan the network and output the results into a text file. A php file is then used to format the text file,
												add a few things, and present the results on a web browser.</p>
										</article>

											<a href="https://cheersake.pythonanywhere.com/home" class="image"><img src="images/nezha2.jpg" alt="" /></a>
											<h3>My First Webpage</h3>
											<p> Applying my knowledge of Python and Flask to create a Portfolio website. For this project, a free web-hosting site was used
												to host the website, where I used Flask to create a simple web server that serves the HTML files. I've also integrated a MySQL
												database into the website which allows new user registration. The website is responsive and works on both mobile and desktop.
												The website is still a work in progress.

												of digits in the sequence. It also includes error handling for invalid inputs and edge cases.</p>
